# Hacker wordlists

A GitHub organization that is a collection of wordlist/payload repositories that can be used for pentesting or other security purposes.

For example:
* [swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)
* [danielmiessler/SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)

I considered maintaining a list like the [awesome-lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) phenomemon, but that seemed like too much maintenance - it is just easier to fork and update forks with GitHub than to update a markdown file.
